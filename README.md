## Assessing a Swarm-GAP Based Solution for the Task Allocation Problem in Dynamic Scenarios

Swarm-GAP is a heuristic that combines a swarm intelligence strategy with the generalized assignment problem (GAP) method. This approach is specially appropriate when there are agents engaged in a collaborative task, but in general, heuristics have drawbacks to optimize resources allocation. A previous work proposed the usage of three swarm-GAP variants to solve the task allocation problem among agents representing a group of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (\uavs) aiming at the optimization of their resources usage. However this approach considered only a non-dynamic scenario, where there is no change in the attributes characterizing the scenario during the system execution. As the original domain of application is related to the military domain, where the primary system requirement is to support an expected high level of dynamism, it is necessary to consider possible changes in the set of attributes. Therefore, the contribution of this study is to obtain empirical evidence about the performance of the original algorithms in dynamic scenarios, and to propose improvements to address the dynamism that was not previously considered. The empirical assessment of the original algorithms and our extension were performed by conducting independent replications in a scenario where the number of agents (\uavs) changes at runtime and adaptations occur to maintain the mission execution. The obtained results with the original and the modified algorithms show that there is a trade-off that can be explored in terms of the resulting quality of the mission performance and the overhead in the communication among the \uavs, even considering small changes in the context attributes.
